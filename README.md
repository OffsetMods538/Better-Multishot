## What is this?
It makes multishot better, duh!

### Features
- 3 levels of multishot
  - Level 1 - vanilla, shoots 3 arrows
  - Level 2 - shoots 5 arrows
  - Level 3 - shoots 7 arrows
- More items enchantable with multishot
  - Bows - the extra arrows do half the damage of the main arrow.
  - Throwables - have to be enchanted individually. Might be changed in a later update...
    - Eggs
    - Ender pearls
    - XP bottles
    - Snowballs
    - Potions
    - Tridents

## But how?
You can enchant crossbows with higher levels of multishot by just using an **enchanting table**.

All the other items will need to be combined with a book in an anvil.  
You can get multishot books from **villagers** or from an **enchanting table**.
