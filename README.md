## What is this?
Ever wanted to shoot 7 arrows from a crossbow?  
What about shooting them from a bow?
Still not impressed? How about throwing 7 *eggs/ender pearls/experience bottles/potions/snowballs* at once?  
Well with **Better Multishot** you can do just that!
## But how?
You can enchant crossbows with higher levels of multishot by just using an **enchanting table**.

All the other stuff will need to be combined with a book in an anvil.  
You can get multishot books from **villagers** or from an **enchanting table**.

> **Note:** By default multishot arrows from bows have halved damage, that can be changed in the config file.
